# Simple file uploader

I found the following interview exercise and I decided to give it a try

## Considerations
- I tried to use the least amount of external dependencies
- I tested on Ubuntu/Mac Os, not guaranteed that'll work on Windows
- By default, the upload folder is in `./../uploads` (I could've added a env variable or passing it by cli)

## Endpoints
- Postman collection here: 

### Get all files


### Upload a file


### Get a file by its name
